# Test Results Folder for Circle Area Calculation App

This folder contains the test results and related files for the Circle Area Calculation App, organized into feature files and step definitions.

## Folder Structure

The `test-results/` folder has the following structure:
```
test-results/
├── features/                 # Folder containing the feature files written in Gherkin syntax
├── step_definitions/         # Folder containing the step definition files for Cucumber
└── playwright.test.js


```

## Files

### `features/`

This folder contains feature files that describe the behavior of the Circle Area Calculation app. These files are written in Gherkin syntax and define the scenarios and expected outcomes.

### `step_definitions/`

This folder contains the step definition files, which map the steps in the Gherkin feature files to executable code. These files use Playwright to automate the browser interactions for testing.

### `playwright.test.js`

This file contains the Playwright test code that interacts with the browser, runs the tests, and verifies the functionality of the app based on the defined scenarios.

## Usage

1. Place your feature files in the `features/` folder.
2. Add the corresponding step definitions in the `step_definitions/` folder.
3. Run the Playwright tests using the following command:

   ```bash
   npx playwright test
    
```
