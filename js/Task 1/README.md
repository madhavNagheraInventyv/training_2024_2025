## Task 1
### Aim
To create a login register page using js and localstorage and a session time of 42secs.
#### Functional Requirements

* User Registration

* Users can register by providing a username and password.

* The credentials are stored in the browser's LocalStorage.

* User Login

* Registered users can log in by providing their credentials.

* Successful login initializes a session.

* Session Management

* A user session lasts for 42 seconds after login.

* If the session expires, the user is logged out automatically.

#### Error Handling

* Proper error messages for invalid credentials, duplicate registrations, and expired sessions.

* Data Persistence

* User credentials are securely stored in LocalStorage.

* No sensitive data (like plaintext passwords) is stored directly; hashed passwords should be used.

* Non-Functional Requirements

#### Responsiveness

* The interface should be accessible on various devices and screen sizes.

#### Performance

* Page load and operations (registration, login, session handling) should execute efficiently.

#### Security

* Basic security measures, such as password hashing and input validation, should be implemented.

* Ease of Use

* The user interface should be simple and intuitive.

#### Constraints

* The application must use JavaScript (no server-side processing).

* Data persistence should rely solely on LocalStorage.

* The session timeout should be precisely 42 seconds.

* External libraries or frameworks may be used but should not complicate the solution unnecessarily.
