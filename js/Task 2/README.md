# Task 2

## Aim
In this task, we worked with JavaScript to manipulate arrays and symbols, and to handle promises.

## Requirements
- Create and manipulate arrays using JavaScript.
- Use symbols as unique identifiers.
- Handle promises to manage asynchronous operations.

## File Synopsis

### Task.js
This file contains the JavaScript code to perform the following operations:
- Create an array of numbers.
- Use an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) to shift the first element from the array and pass it along with the rest of the array to another function.
- In the second function, create another array of symbols and unshift the first element from the previous array.
- Manually append the rest of the elements from the previous array to the new array without using the `push` method.
- Use array methods like `shift`, `unshift` to manipulate array
- Use a promise to check if the sum is greater than 30 and resolve or reject accordingly.



### Symbol_Task.js
This file contains the JavaScript code to perform the following operations:
- Create an array of symbols.
- Use an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) to shift the first element from the array and pass it along with the rest of the array to another function.
- In the second function, create another array of symbols and unshift the first element from the previous array.
- Manually append the rest of the elements from the previous array to the new array without using the `push` method.
- Convert the symbols to their respective values and calculate the sum.
- Use a promise to check if the sum is greater than 30 and resolve or reject accordingly.



## Takeaway from Task 2
- Understanding the use of symbols in JavaScript as unique identifiers.
- Manipulating arrays using various methods like `shift`, `unshift`, and manual appending.
- Handling promises to manage asynchronous operations and error handling.
- Using IIFE to encapsulate code and avoid polluting the global scope.
- Simulating asynchronous operations using promises to handle real-world scenarios.
- Enhancing problem-solving skills by combining different JavaScript concepts to achieve the desired outcome.
