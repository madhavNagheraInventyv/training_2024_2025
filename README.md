# training_2024_2025

Aim: To establish a centralized, well-organized folder structure for managing and maintaining projects across multiple programming languages and technologies, ensuring scalability, accessibility, and consistency for future development, testing, and collaboration.

# Key Objectives  #
* Modularity:
Organize projects into separate subfolders by language, framework, or technology to simplify navigation.

* Scalability:
Enable easy addition of new projects, languages, or frameworks without compromising folder clarity.

* Reusability:
Include common assets, shared libraries, and documentation that can be reused across projects.

* Documentation:
Maintain clear documentation for each project and the main folder (e.g., README.md files) to facilitate onboarding and reference.
