# Flowchart Task

## Overview

Flowcharts are visual tools used to represent processes, workflows, or algorithms. They simplify complex systems by breaking them into individual steps using symbols and connections. This task involves creating flowcharts to represent different types of workflows.

## Syntax of Flowcharts

### Basic Symbols
- *Oval*: Represents the start or end of a process.  

- *Rectangle*: Represents a process or task.  

- *Diamond*: Represents a decision point.  

- *Arrow*: Indicates the flow direction. 

- *parallelogram*: Represents a read , write operation

## Types of Flowcharts and Syntax

### 1. *Selection Flowchart (Simple Flowchart)*  
Used for decision-making processes with straightforward paths.  

*Questions :*  
- areaofcircle.js: Write a flowchart and program to calculate the area of a circle.  
- parameterOfRectangle.js: Write a flowchart and program to calculate the area of a circle and the perimeter of a rectangle.

### 2. *Sequence Flowchart (Complex Flowchart)*  
Represents detailed workflows with multiple sequential steps.  

*Questions :*  
 maxamongx&y.js: Write a flowchart and program to find the maximum of two numbers (x and y).  
- maxamongX&Y&Z.js: Write a flowchart and program to find the maximum of three numbers (x, y, and z).

### 3. *Iterative Flowchart (Dynamic Flowchart)*  
Illustrates loops or iterative processes.  

*Questions :*   
- Factorialofn.js: Write a flowchart and program to calculate the factorial of a number (n).  
- print1to5.js: Write a flowchart and program to print numbers from 1 to n.  
- series: Print the series 1 -2 3 -4 ... n.  
- factorialserires: Print the series 1! 3! 5! ... n.  
- factorialserires1: Print the series 1! -3! 5! -7! ... n.  
- series2: Print the series 1121231234123451234561234567...n.  
- series3: Print the series 1121123211234321123454321...n.  
- sinxseries: Write a flowchart and program to calculate the value of sin(x) using its series expansion.  
- sumOf1to5.js: Write a flowchart and program to calculate the sum of the first n numbers.
